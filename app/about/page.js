        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Founded with the idea that everyone deserves a little encouragement, Tea Time started as a small platform where creators could receive support in the form of virtual cups of tea. Inspired by the warmth and connection a shared cup brings, we wanted to offer a simple, cozy way for fans to show appreciation to the creators they love.
